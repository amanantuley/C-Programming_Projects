## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Practice control flow (`if`, `switch`, `loops`)
* Work with **functions** and modular code
* Learn **file handling** (`fopen`, `fprintf`, `fscanf`, etc.)
* Understand **menu-driven interfaces**
* Improve **CLI interactivity** in C
* Implement small-scale simulations of real-world systems
